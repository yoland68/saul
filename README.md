- Are you frustrated with writing logs?
- Are you frustrated with time consuming code refactor that a 5-year can do?
- Do you know you have rights as a software develper? 

Well, you **better call saul.py**

This project aim to create scripts with Antlr4 and predefined Antlr4 grammars
to tokenize source code and refactor them

## Prerequisites

1. Python3 (investigating a python2 antlr runtime bug)

## Installation

0. (Optional) [Install Antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md).
You only need this if you want to generate new lex/parser file for a language

1. **Install Antlr4 Python3 runtime**
```bash
pip install antlr4-python3-runtime
```

2. **Download this repo to your source code repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoland68/saul
```

## Usage

Better call `python3 saul/src/saul.py -h` to learn how to use saul.py

Check exiting agents, better call `python3 saul/src/saul.py -l`
